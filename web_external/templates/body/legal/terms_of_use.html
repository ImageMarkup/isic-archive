<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Terms of Use. </em></strong>
<p>Unless you or your employer have entered into a separate written Agreement with MSKCC which specifically supersedes this Terms of Use Agreement, this Terms of Use Agreement and the agreements referenced herein (the “<strong><em>Agreement</em></strong>” or “<strong><em>Terms of Use”</em></strong>) constitute the entire agreement between MSKCC on the one hand, and users of this Site (“<strong><em>Users</em></strong>”), on the other hand, pertaining to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement binds users of the Site whether or not they contribute to the Site. However, contributors to the Site are required to affirm assent to this Agreement and otherwise conform to the provisions of Section 2 in order to contribute content. Access, contribution to, or use of the Site all signify assent by contributors and Users to all terms of the Agreement.</li>
<li><strong><em>Account Information. </em></strong>
<ol>
<li>The Site may be accessed and used without creation of an account with MSKCC. However, if you wish to upload a digital image (“<strong><em>Image</em></strong>”) of a skin lesion to the Site or to provide an annotation for such an Image (an “<strong><em>Annotation”)</em></strong>, you will be required to register an account (“<strong><em>Account</em></strong>”) and abide by the terms of this Agreement. To register an Account, you will be required to provide MSKCC with certain contact information. In registering the Account, you represent and warrant that such contact information is accurate and complete. Failure to comply with the foregoing shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Use, which may result in the immediate termination and deletion of the Account. Use of the term “Image” or “Annotation” in this Agreement includes the plural, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</li>
<li>All contact information provided by you shall be governed by the Site Privacy Policy, as discussed in Section 10.</li>
<li>Each Account will be accessible by means of a password. If you register an Account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or Account. You agree to immediately notify MSKCC if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or Account or any other breach of security.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong><em>Contributions.</em></strong>
<ol>
<li>If you have registered an Account, you may provide or upload Images to the Site. Upon submitting Images to the Site, you will be required to select one of three Creative Commons (https://creativecommons.org) licenses (either CC0, BY, or BY-NC,) to apply to the Images (the “<strong><em>Contributor License</em></strong>”). If you do not or cannot agree to apply one of these licenses to a contributed Image, do not upload your Image. You agree only to post or upload Images to which you have been duly authorized to transmit and license to MSKCC and to Users in accordance with this Agreement and the Contributor License you select for each Image and/or to which you own all copyrights and other rights. You agree, represent and warrant that use of the Images you have posted or uploaded in connection with the Site does not and will not violate or infringe the copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, HIPAA (as defined below) or any other intellectual property or other rights, of any kind or nature whatsoever, of any person(s) or entity(ies).</li>
<li>If you have registered an Account, as an additional, optional capability, you may be permitted to annotate Images to note certain relevant attributes in response to questions automatically posed by the Site. These Annotations are stored and may be available for download separately from the original Image or together with the original Image. Annotations, when made available, may include the User name of the User providing the Annotation. You agree that every and any annotation which you submit will be licensed under Creative Commons (https://creativecommons.org) license CC0. The derivative work formed by combining an Annotation with the applicable Image will be licensed under the applicable Contributor license for that Image. If you do not or cannot agree to apply Creative Commons license CC0 to your Annotation, do not contribute your Annotation. You agree only to provide Annotations to which you own all copyrights and other rights, and/or to which you have been duly authorized to transmit and license to MSKCC and to Users in accordance with this Agreement and the Creative Commons license CC0. You agree, represent and warrant that use of the Annotations you have posted or uploaded in connection with the Site does not and will not violate or infringe the copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, HIPAA (as defined below) or any other intellectual property or other rights, of any kind or nature whatsoever, of any person(s) or entity(ies).</li>
<li>Should any part of the Contributor License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the Contributor License, and in such case you hereby affirm that you will not (i) exercise any of your rights in the Images which were purportedly granted by the selected Contributor License <em>or</em> (ii) assert against (x) Users or (y) MSKCC or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, successors, licensees or assignees (jointly and severally, MSKCC and any and all of the foregoing listed in subsection (y) are the “<strong><em>MSKCC Protected Parties</em></strong>”), any associated claims or causes of action with respect to the Images.</li>
<li>You agree, represent and warrant the following for any Images and Annotations you submit or contribute:
<ol>
<li>The Images and Annotations, including any file names, captions or other metadata, do not contain any Individually Identifiable Health Information, as defined at 45 C.F.R. 160.103, of the subject of the Images or Annotation, or of anyone else, including any of the 18 individual identifiers listed at 45 C.F.R. 164.514(b)(2)(i) (such as, but not limited to, name, street address, phone number, dates of treatment, email address, URL, or identifiable face, feature or marking) (“<strong><em>Protected Health Information</em></strong>” or “<strong><em>PHI</em></strong>”), or that the Images and Annotations have otherwise been rendered de-identified in accordance with the requirements for de-identification set forth at 45 C.F.R. 164.514 (“De-identified Images”), or, if the Images or Annotation are subject to a jurisdiction outside of the United States, that the Images or Annotation have been rendered de-identified in accordance with the requirements for de-identification in the applicable foreign jurisdiction; or</li>
<li>For any Images or Annotations that contain PHI or other personally identifying information (collectively, “<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>”), you have obtained a valid written authorization from the subject of the Images or Annotations, which authorization satisfies the requirements set forth at 45 CFR 164.508; <em>and</em></li>
<li>If you, as a contributor, or any Images or Annotations you submit or contribute, are subject to other privacy laws, regulations, directives or agreements outside of the United States, you agree, represent and warrant that, prior to upload or submission, you have obtained any and all consents, permissions, authorizations or approvals, including from any persons appearing in any Images or Annotations which you upload or submit, and have taken such other steps as may be required by the applicable jurisdiction or institution. <strong>You hereby acknowledge that all such Images, Annotations, or other data may be transferred to the United States and/or other countries that have laws less protective of data privacy than those of your country of residence or the jurisdiction applicable to the Images or Annotations. You hereby consent to such transfer.</strong></li>
<li>You further agree, represent and warrant that you have obtained any consent needed for you to grant the Contributor License. Contributors are expected to provide non-identifiable medical details associated with specific images (e.g., diagnosis, patient age, patient history of skin cancer). You agree, represent and warrant that the non-identifiable medical details you provide for each Image will be current, accurate, and correct as of the time of upload. If you determine that the non-identifiable medical details you submitted at the time of upload were incorrect, you agree to send an email to the email address identified in the “Contacts” section of the Site and to include in the message the correct details and identification of the Image.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Any Personal Information disclosed in or with the Images or Annotations may be accessible to the general public. If you upload Personal Information, you acknowledge that the following may be deemed to apply to your use and disclosure: (i) certain sections of the Administrative Simplification section of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-191, enacted Aug. 21, 1996 (codified at 42 U.S.C. §1320d); (ii) the regulations concerning privacy and security of health-related information and personally identifiable financial data as set forth at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 through 164 and the federal security regulations set forth in 45 C.F.R. Part 142, and as amended (subsections (i) and (ii) referred to collectively as “HIPAA Requirements”); or (iii) other privacy directives, laws or regulations.</li>
<li>Furthermore, to the extent it is alleged or determined at any time that the HIPAA Requirements, EU General Data Protection Regulation, EU-US Privacy Shield, EU Data Protection Directive, privacy laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction, or third-party rights are implicated by your disclosure of Personal Information, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the MSKCC Protected Parties from any claim, demand, or regulatory action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of regulatory investigations, made by any third party due to or arising out of your provision of the Images and Annotations, use of and access to the Site and disclosure of personally identifiable information in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
<li>MSKCC reserves the right to review all Images and Annotations prior to or after contribution or submission to the Site and to remove them for any reason, at any time, without prior notice, at its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no exercise, or failure to exercise, or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy vested in MSKCC or the MSKCC Protected Parties under this provision shall constitute a waiver by MSKCC or the MSKCC Protected Parties of that or any other right, power or remedy. MSKCC does not guarantee that it will review or remove any Image, Annotation or other content.</li>
