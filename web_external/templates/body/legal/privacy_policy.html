<p><strong>Last Revised: October 3, 2016</strong></p>
<p>We, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“<strong><em>MSKCC</em></strong>”), provide this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information received from users of this Site, located at http://isdis.net/isic-project/public-image-archive-of-skin-lesions/ (the <strong>&quot;<em>Site</em></strong>&quot;). References to MSKCC include &quot;<strong><em>MSKCC Protected Parties</em></strong>,&quot; which means MSKCC and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, successors, licensees, or assignees (both jointly and severally).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. As a user or contributor (each a &quot;<strong><em>User</em></strong>&quot;) of this Site, you are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. This Privacy Policy is integrated with and is a part of our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>By using our Site and/or agreeing to our Terms of Use, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set out in the Privacy Policy, as may be amended from time to time. In this Privacy Policy, &quot;<strong><em>Processing</em></strong>&quot; means using cookies on an electronic device (such as a computer) or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining, and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S., your personal information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and Processing of your information in, the U.S.</p>

<li><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Information We Collect</em>.</strong>
The information we gather on our Site falls into three categories: (1) information you supply when you register; (2) information, contributions, <strong>“Annotations”</strong> or &quot;<strong><em>Images</em></strong>&quot; (as the terms are defined in the Terms of Use) which you upload to the Site; and (3) tracking and analytics information we may collect as you navigate through our Site. If you do not want the Site to collect your personal information, you should not use, register for, provide user feedback to, or make submissions or contributions to the Site.</li>
<li><strong><em>Registration Information</em>.</strong> To use certain features on our Site, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personal information about you, which may include your name, organization name, mailing address, email address, a password, time of registration / most recent login and User name. We may also ask for some additional, optional information, but you're free to register without providing this optional information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on our Site, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including when you: complete a survey or report a problem with our Site. We use this information to tailor our Site to your interests and to make it more useful to you, and to help improve our Site generally.</li>
<li><strong><em>Tracking Information (Cookies)</em>.</strong> To help us serve your needs better, we use &quot;cookies&quot; to store and sometimes to track User information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your electronic device's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our Site to identify your electronic device. For example, cookies allow us to personalize the Site, restrict access to authorized Users, attribute contributions to the User that made them, and keep track of your User name and password (if you are a registered User) so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit our Site. In the event that a User is not logged into the Site, we may still store a cookie to track whether the User has accepted the Terms of Use Agreement dialog (which the User must do before visiting any pages with actual data). Finally, the Site makes use of Google Analytics, which may use cookies as specified at <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage" class="uri">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage</a>. Google Analytics allows us to determine important metrics about the usage of our Site.</li>
<li><strong><em>Tracking Information (IP Address)</em>.</strong> We may also collect information about your access time, the page or data requested, and your device configuration, including the type and version of browser software you use, the operating system that you're running, the resolution of your monitor and your Internet Protocol address (&quot;<strong><em>IP address</em></strong>&quot;). Your IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) connected to the Internet, which identifies your computer or device so that data (such as the web pages you view) can be accessed by you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the other information described in this paragraph identifies you personally, although it may indicate your location. In the event of a Site malfunction, we may associate IP addresses with internal logs that contain account information for the limited purpose of correcting the malfunction. Otherwise, we only collect this information for purposes of aggregated reporting on Site activity that we, and our contractors, if any, may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average User spends on our Site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The aggregated information helps to understand our audience. We may share such aggregated, de-personalized data with third parties.<br>
Since the Site makes use of Google Analytics, that service may also be collecting IP addresses under their own terms. The “Help” function button on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of various features on our Site that are available to other Users.</li>

<li><strong><em>Notice to California Residents -- Your California Privacy Rights</em>.</strong> Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the Company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes and a disclosure of the shared information. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that provides you with an “opt-out” choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the Company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.<br>
This Site qualifies for the alternative option. In addition, MSKCC does not use your personal information for direct marketing purposes. Its privacy policy provides you with information on how you may opt-out from the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.<br>
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, send a request in accordance with the Contacts section below.</li>
